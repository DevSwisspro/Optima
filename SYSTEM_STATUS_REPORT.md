## 🚨 IDENTIFIED ISSUES

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues**

1. **Local Build Permission Error**
   ```bash
   Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, mkdir 'dist/assets'
   ```
   - **Impact:** Cannot build locally for testing
   - **Status:** Requires Windows permission fix
   - **Workaround:** Netlify auto-builds on push

2. **Live Application Loading Issue**

   - **Expected:** Full React application interface
   - **Possible Cause:** Build/deployment issue or missing environment variables

### ⚠️ **Pending Tasks**

1. **Database Schema Execution**
   - Schema SQL file exists but needs to be executed in Supabase
   - All table structures are defined and ready
   - RLS policies configured for security

2. **Netlify Projects Cleanup**
   - Need to audit all Netlify projects under account
   - Remove duplicate/unused deployments
   - Keep only: `todo-coach-app-1757010879`

3. Delete unused deployments (keep only `todo-coach-app-1757010879`)
4. Verify environment variables are properly set

### **Priority 3: Live Application Test**
1. Test application functionality after database setup
2. Verify all features work (budget, tasks, notes, shopping)
3. Confirm mobile responsiveness
4. Test data persistence across sessions

### **Priority 4: Fix Local Development**
1. Resolve Windows permission issues with dist directory
2. Enable local testing and development
